TUTORIAL06_CHO_06	Perhaps.		xxx
TUTORIAL06_CHO_07	Ah! You cannot reach me!		xxx
TUTORIAL06_CHO_08	Everyone looks so tiny from way up here!		xxx
TUTORIAL06_CHO_09	Even a single point of damage can mean the difference between victory and defeat.		xxx
TUTORIAL06_CHO_12	Oh... You are quite powerful.		xxx
TUTORIAL06_CHO_15	I am not all that handy with swords or bows, but I do have many friends.		xxx
TUTORIAL06_CHO_17	I have made some new friends who can heal, as well as fight!		xxx
TUTORIAL06_CHO_20	Oh! This is becoming unBEARable!		xxx
TUTORIAL06_CHO_21	Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate.  Hate leads to an upset tummy.		xxx
TUTORIAL06_JAINA_01	Lorewalker Cho.		xxx
TUTORIAL06_JAINA_02	I won't hold back.		xxx
